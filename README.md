# micro:bit Games

### Maze
Tilt the micro:bit to navigate through a maze and find the sparkling treasure. Press the A button to toggle between vertical tilt mode and horizontal tilt mode. Press the B button to change maze difficulty.

Initially based on rhubarbdog's game: https://github.com/rhubarbdog/microbit-games. Refactored, added dynamic maze generation and button functionality for changing orientation and difficulty.

### More?
Waiting for my kids to be old enough to give me ideas.
